## Cafe Database Website - Using Restful API, SQlite, Flask for backend, and Bootstrap for frontend
# Overview
This is a database based website that uses sqlite for the database elements, Flask for backend and Bootstrap for frontend. It allows the user to search within the database for a cafe of their liking, or offers random choice. They can also add thheir own cafes with hidden functionality of updating prices, and removing from the database.
# What I learned/ Challenges  I faced
This was my first time building a website that used SQLite, bootstrap and Flask, so was very much getting to grips with creating a functional website, with much less importance being put on the aesthetics.
